Synopsis: Update SunOS 4.1.1 to SunOS 4.1.1_U1

Directions for patch installation:

    Install SunOS 4.1.1 (since you're reading this, you've probably
    already done that...)

    have a closer look on the Files included in the tar-Archive...one is
    a shell-script which installs the stuff from tape...I've done this a
    while ago and I don't remember what I hat to do...but it somehow works ;)

    Sorry for such a bad help...
