<h1></A>Welcome to the Sun3 Misc Patch Archive</h1>
This patches are non-official (and I think Non-Sun) but give you a nice 
addon to your good, old SunOS 4.1.1. I found them somewhere and maybe you 
find them usefull. I do so!
<p>
This archive contains only patches for SunOS 4.1.1 and Sun3/3x 
architecture only!!!
<p>
There's a new section related to Y2000!
