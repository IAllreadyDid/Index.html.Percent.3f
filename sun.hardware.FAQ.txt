INTRODUCTION
============

   This is the Sun Hardware Reference, which attempts to provide as much
information as possible about older Sun-badged hardware and hardware
commonly used with older Sun workstations. Its primary audience is
buyers and collectors of used Sun hardware, much of which comes without
documentation.

   THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND on the information in this document.
It has been assembled from a variety of sources of varying reliability.
Efforts have been made to exclude information known to be incorrect, and
to include only information deemed reasonably reliable, but there is no
guarantee on any of it, especially since official Sun documents
occasionally contradict each other.

   This document is copyright (c) 1995, 1996, 1997 by James W. Birdsall.
You may distribute it freely in unmodified form.

   THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. I still have a lot of
information which I have not had time to integrate yet. However, I am
always looking for more -- if you have documentation for systems or
boards not listed here, please let me know!


OFFICIAL HOME OF THIS DOCUMENT
==============================

   The official home of this document is ftp.picarefy.com, available via
anonymous FTP in the /pub/Sun-Hardware-Ref directory. My connection to
the outside world is slow, so you may want to try one of the sites
listed below.

   It is also available via anonymous FTP from:

        ftp.chicks.net          /pub/unix/sun-hardware

   IF YOU GOT THIS DOCUMENT FROM ANYWHERE ELSE, IT IS AN UNOFFICIAL
SITE! There is no guarantee that this is the latest version (which may
contain significant and important changes).

   If you wish to make the Sun Hardware Reference available on your
site, please contact me at jwbirdsa@picarefy.com and I will put you on
the mailing list. You will be notified whenever a new version is ready.


HOW TO USE THE REFERENCE
========================

   This document is broadly divided into a few high-level categories
(model summary, hardware, special topics, etc.), each of which is
divided into more specific sections and sometimes even subsections.

   Each section or subsection normally consists of:

        + an introduction
        + a FAQ
        + an overview by model
        + any special topics related to the subject
        + a listing by part number

   So, for example, to find out:

        + what models can use the same memory, look under
          "HARDWARE/Boards/Memory/Overview by Model".

        + about SCSI ID settings, look under "HARDWARE/Mass Storage/SCSI
          Overview".

        + how many colors a "cgfour" framebuffer supports, look under
          "HARDWARE/Boards/Video/Standards".

        + how to arrange boards in your VME-based machine, look under
          "SPECIAL TOPICS/Cardcage Configuration" (to find out what VME
          is, look under "SPECIAL TOPICS/Busses").

        + the pinout of your system's serial port, look under "SPECIAL
          TOPICS/Pinout Summary".

        + what a xxx-xxxx (e.g. 501-1102) is and details about it, look
          in the "PART NUMBER INDEX". If there is any information about
          that part in the Reference, that index will tell you what
          section to look in (and may at least give you a name for the
          item even if no other information is known). Once you know the
          section, check the "Listing by Part Number" under that
          section.

   I have attempted to crossreference items as much as possible. So, if
you went looking for a serial port pinout under "HARDWARE/Boards/CPUs
/Listing by Part Number/xxx-xxxx", you would find a pointer to "SPECIAL
TOPICS/Pinout Summary".

MODELS SUMMARY
==============

   Introduction
   ------------

   Sun's workstations can be broadly divided into five families: Sun-1,
Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun386i, and Sun-4. The first three use successive
generations of the Motorola 680x0 microprocessor. The Sun386i family
was an abortive attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the Intel
80386 in IBM PC-compatibles. With the Sun-4 family, Sun moved to a RISC
microprocessor of their own design, the SPARC.

   FAQ
   ---

1)  How do I tell what model I have?
2a) What's the first/last version of SunOS for my sun2?
2b) ...sun3? sun3x?
2c) ...sun386i?
2d) ...sun4*?


1)  How do I tell what model I have?

        It isn't necessarily easy.

        Later models (most Sun-3's and later) usually have a model
        designation on the chassis. However, in many cases there is
        nothing tying a particular chassis to a particular motherboard
        or CPU, and that's what really determines what model a
        particular machine is. This is especially true for VME-based
        chassis, where CPUs could be swapped with ease, frequently
        creating combinations which Sun never intended.

        There are two ways to really be sure what you have: 1) look up
        the part number on the CPU board or 2) watch the machine boot
        from being powered off -- the boot ROM should display a banner
        which indicates what model (or family, in the case of CPUs which
        could be used in many models) the CPU belongs to.

        That's all you really need to know. If you're curious, you can
        check the list of official models below to see if anything
        matches what you have.

2a)  What's the first/last version of SunOS for my sun2?

        All Sun-2 machines have the same kernel architecture ("sun2")
        and run the same versions of SunOS.

        SunOS was originally written for the Sun-2 (and Sun 100U, which
        is actually a Sun-2 CPU), so the first official version of SunOS
        for the Sun-2 is 1.0.

        The last version is 4.0.3. Note that SunOS 4.x for Sun-2's is
        only known to exist on QIC-24 tapes, not QIC-11 (which was the
        standard for Sun-2's). Hence, installing SunOS 4.x will require
        a QIC-24 drive (most easily acquired from a Sun-3, where it was
        the standard) and boot ROM version 1.1.2, which is required to
        boot from a QIC-24 drive. Depending on the part number of your
        CPU board, it may be necessary to move a jumper as well in order
        to install and run SunOS 4.x.

2b)  What's the first/last version of SunOS for my sun3? sun3x?

        There are two different kernel architectures in the Sun-3 model
        line. All 68020-based models are "sun3"; 68030-based models (the
        3/80 and 3/4xx) are "sun3x" architecture. Note that the
        difference only applies to the kernel; any program compiled on
        one architecture should run on the other.

        Support for Sun-3's was introduced in SunOS 3.0.

        The last version is 4.1.1U1.

2c)  What's the first/last version of SunOS for my sun386i?

        All Sun386i machines have the same kernel architecture
        ("sun386i") and run the same versions of SunOS.

        Support for Sun386i's was introduced in SunOS 4.0 (?). The 386i
        SunOS releases came from Sun's East Coast division, so 386i
        SunOS was not identical to the standard version with the same
        number.

        The last released version is 4.0.2; there are a few copies of
        4.0.3Beta (with OpenLook 2.0) floating around.

2d)  What's the first/last version of SunOS for my sun4*?

        There are half a dozen different kernel architectures in the
        Sun-4 model line. The architecture is given for each model in
        the model listing below, and is also given in the writeup for
        each CPU/motherboard.

        The first version of SunOS depends on the model. For the
        earliest Sun-4's ("sun4" architecture), support was officially
        introduced in SunOS 4.0, although there was a special variant of
        SunOS 3.2 for Sun-4's which was shipped with some very early
        units. If the first version is not SunOS 4.0, that is given in
        the model listing and the writeup for the CPU/motherboard.

        Since this product line is still current, it is still in general
        supported by SunOS, which is now part of Solaris. Support for
        the "sun4" architecture was dropped in Solaris 2.5. The
        remaining support for the VME bus (for the benefit of the 4/6xx,
        the only VME-based Sun-4 which is not "sun4" architecture) is
        being dropped in Solaris 2.6.

   Sun-1 Family
   ------------

   Sun-1's were the very first models ever produced by Sun. The earliest
ran Unisoft V7 UNIX; SunOS 1.x was introduced later. According to some
sources, fewer than 200 Sun-1's were ever produced; they are certainly
rare. The switch from Motorola 68000's to 68010's occurred during the
Sun-1's reign.

   68000-based Sun-1's are not supported by SunOS.

   From bjork@rahul.net (../Steven):

        [The Sun-1] did not have the DVMA of the sun2 architecture.
        There was an even earlier board that had the 68000, not the
        68010. The 68000 board was licensed by Stanford to several folks
        (can't recall names). The original cisco CPU was a slightly
        upgraded 68000 version. Andy Bechtolsheim was using SUDS on the
        triple-I in the CS Dungeon (Margaret Jacks Hall) when my boss
        asked him to modify the sun board to accept 256K RAM chips. I
        handed Andy a pencil and the schematics and he scribbled the
        mods on it. I took the mods, and with Exacto knife and jumpers,
        modified a sun board for the 256K chips. Len Bosack then took
        the mods and re-layed out the PC. That board was the first cisco
        CPU, and was also produced internally to Stanford.

        [...]

        The original sun lacked the DVMA and thus needed Multibus
        memory. Their "ar" tape controller design thus included 256K of
        Multibus memory. When upgraded to a sun2, one had to switch this
        ar-resident memory off since it would conflict with the DVMA
        memory on the sun2 P2 (memory bus).

   Sun-2 Family
   ------------

   Sun-2's were introduced in the early 1980's and were Sun's first
major commercial success. While not as popular or as common as the later
Sun-3's, they did well and there are still quite a few in circulation in
the home/collector-used market.

   All Sun-2's are based on the Motorola 68010 and run SunOS. Early
Sun-2's were Multibus; later models were VME, which Sun continued to use
through the Sun-3 era and well into the Sun-4 line.

   One of the hardest parts of restoring a Sun-2 is finding SunOS tapes
for it. The hardware is usually still in fine working order, but tapes
-- if you can even find any -- are sometimes unreadable after so many
years. (See "SOFTWARE/Sun-2 SunOS Tapes".)

   Sun-3 Family
   ------------

   Sun switched to using the Motorola 68020 with the introduction of the
Sun-3's.  A few later models had 68030's, but by that time Sun was
already moving to SPARC processors. All models either have a 68881 or
68882 FPU installed stock or at least have a socket for one. All models
except the 3/80 have a VME bus, more or less (the 3/50 and 3/60 are
single-board-only machines and have only the VME power connector). The
3/60 and 3/80 also have a "P4" connector which can take a framebuffer.

   During the Sun-3 era, Sun introduced the handy practice of putting
the model number on the Sun badge on the front of the chassis. While
there is no guarantee that the badge accurately represents the CPU
installed, at least it's a starting point.

   Sun386i Family
   --------------

   The Sun386i models, based on the Intel 80386 processor, were
introduced when 80386-based IBM PC/AT clones were starting to become
widespread. Intel had finally produced an 80x86 chip sufficiently
capable (32-bit, among other things) to allow porting SunOS, and using
an Intel processor and an ISA bus offered the ability to run MS-DOS
applications without speed-draining emulation. Unfortunately, they were
a market failure, and a planned 486-based follow-on machine was
cancelled.

   Sun-4 (aka SPARCstation) Family
   -------------------------------

   The Sun-4 line was initially introduced with model designations in
the same pattern as previous lines: Sun 4/xxx. However, for marketing
purposes, Sun departed from their classic naming scheme with the name
SPARCstation, and has since experimented with alphabetic designations
(e.g. "SPARCstation SLC") before returning to numbered SPARCstations.
Until the SPARCstation 10, however, every model still had a 4/xxx
designation as well, which is displayed by the ROM monitor during
power-up and is used by much of Sun's documentation.

   This model line marks the introduction of Sun's own RISC chip, the
SPARC. There have been a number of different implementations of the chip
from various manufacturers, with varying degrees of hardware support for
the instruction set. (See "SPECIAL TOPICS/SPARC Chips".)

   Some of the later models have pictures silkscreened on their CPU
boards.

   Overview by Model
   -----------------

   This section lists all the models within each family. They are listed
approximately in order of introduction.

   For each model listed, whatever information is available is given, in
the following order:

   Processor:   + microprocessor followed by its clock speed in MHz
                + floating point coprocessor (FPU), if any
                + MMU details, including the number of hardware contexts

        Note that some SPARC processors are referred to by name;
        information on these is available under "SPECIAL TOPICS/SPARC
        Chips."

   Speed ratings:
                + MIPS (Millions of/Meaningless Instructions Per Second)
                + MFLOPS (Millions of FLoating-point OPerations per Second)
                + SPECmark89
                + SPECint92/SPECfp92/SPECintRate92/SPECfpRate92


   CPU or motherboard: The Sun part number of the CPU board or
        motherboard.

   Chassis type:
                + "Rackmount" chassis, as the name suggests, are
                  designed to fit into a standard 19" equipment rack.
                  They usually require clearance over and under the
                  chassis for cooling.
                + "Pizza box" chassis are intended to sit on a desktop,
                  typically underneath the monitor; they are low, wide,
                  and deep. Older pizza boxes (2/50, 3/75, 3/50, and
                  3/60) are much wider than they are deep; newer ones
                  are square (3/80, SPARCstation 1, 1+, 2, etc.). Some
                  older pizza boxes (mostly the 3/50) have a 'dimple
                  top', a case top with a circular depression that
                  allows the chassis to serve as a tilt/swivel monitor
                  base directly.
                + "deskside" chassis are large towers that are intended
                  to stand on the floor. Nine-slot Multibus and
                  six-or-more-slot VME chassis fall into this category.
                  Three-slot VME chassis are listed as deskside but can
                  also be used as fat pizza boxes, on their sides on
                  deskstops.
                + "lunchbox" chassis are small rectangular boxes the
                  size of a lunchbox. They sit on desktops.
                + "monitor" chassis have the motherboard hidden in the
                  back of the monitor.
                + "tower" chassis are reminiscent of modern PC-clone
                  tower chassis.

   Bus: Whatever bus or busses the machine has. Sun has, at various
        times, used Multibus, VMEbus, ISA, SBus, MBus, and XDBus.

   Memory:      + amount of physical memory the machine can take
                  (according to official Sun documentation; frequently
                  more was possible in undocumented configurations or
                  with third-party memory boards -- if this is believed
                  to be true, the limit is labelled "documented")
                + "ECC" if memory has error correction
                + maximum size of the machine's virtual memory space
                + cycle time for physical memory

   Cache: Details of any on-chip or off-chip caches. The on-chip caches
        of Motorola and Intel processors are not described. The on-chip
        caches of various SPARC processors are described under "SPECIAL
        TOPICS/SPARC Chips" section. Off-chip caches on Sun-4 models
        which take MBus modules are a function of the MBus modules
        installed (see "HARDWARE/Boards/SPARC (MBus) Modules").

   Architecture: For Sun-4 models only, the kernel architecture "sun4?"
        is given. The only other model line to have multiple kernel
        architectures is the Sun-3, which are easily distinguishable
        (68020-based machines are "sun3", 68030-based machines are
        "sun3x").

        Notes:          Large black desktop boxes with 17" monitors.
                        Uses the original Stanford-designed video board
                        and a parallel microswitch keyboard (type 1) and
                        parallel mouse (Sun-1).

    100
        Processor(s):   68000 @ 10MHz
        Bus:            Multibus (serial?)
        Notes:          Uses a design similar to original SUN (Stanford
                        University Network) CPU. The version 1.5 CPU can
                        take larger RAMs.

    170
        Processor(s):   68010?
        Bus:            Multibus?
        Chassis type:   rackmount
        Notes:          Server. Slightly different chassis design than
                        2/170.

      Sun-2 Models
      ------------

        Memory:         7M physical
        Notes:          First machines in deskside chassis. Serial
                        microswitch keyboard (type 2), Mouse Systems
                        optical mouse (Sun-2).

    2/100U
        Processor(s):   68010 @ 10MHz
        CPU:            501-1007
        Bus:            Multibus
        Notes:          Upgraded Sun 100. Replaced CPU and memory boards
                        with first-generation Sun-2 CPU and memory
                        boards so original customers could run SunOS
                        1.x. Still has parallel kb/mouse interface so
                        type 1 keyboards and Sun-1 mice could be
                        connected.

    2/150U
        Notes:          Apparently also an upgraded Sun-1.

    2/170
        Chassis type:   rackmount
        Bus:            Multibus (15 slots)
        Notes:          Rackmount version of 2/120, with more slots.

    2/50
        Processor(s):   68010 @ 10MHz
        CPU:            501-1141/1142/1143/1426/1427/1428
        Chassis type:   wide pizza box
        Bus:            VME (2 slots)
        Memory:         7M physical
        Notes:          The (type 2) keyboard and mouse attach via an
                        adapter that accepts two modular plugs and
                        attaches to a DB15 port.

    2/130
    2/160
        Processor(s):   68010 @ 10MHz
        CPU:            501-1144/1145/1146/1429/1430/1431

        Bus:            VME (12 slots)
        Memory:         7M physical
        Notes:          First machine in 12-slot deskside VME chassis.
                        Has four-fan cooling tray instead of six as in
                        later machines, which led to cooling problems
                        with lots of cards. Backplane has only four P2
                        memory connectors bussed instead of six as in
                        later 12-slot backplanes; SCSI passthrough is in
                        slot 6 instead of 7 as in later 12-slot
                        backplanes. Upgradeable to a 3/160 by replacing
                        the CPU board. No information on the differences
                        between the 2/130 and the 2/160.

                        "Carrera" CPU, which is used in most other Sun
                        3/1xx models and the 3/75. Sun supplied 4M
                        memory expansion boards; third parties had up to
                        32M on one card. Slot 7 of the backplane has
                        SCSI bus passthrough for internal SCSI devices
                        (slot 6 in upgrades from 2/130, 2/160), used

                        intended as single-board machine, although there
                        are a few slave-only VME boards (such as the

                        chassis is conductive, so internal disk drives
                        must be mounted with insulating hardware.

      CPUs/Motherboards
      -----------------

         Introduction
         ------------

   The distinction between CPUs and motherboards in Sun machines is a
fine one. Until the 3/80, Sun386i family, and SPARCstation 1, the actual
microprocessor and associated support circuitry resided on a Multibus or
VME board (which I have termed a 'CPU'). The bus slots were on a
separate circuit board, the backplane, and the CPU plugged into the
backplane just like any other board (barring some special requirements
about which slot it went in). The models mentioned above introduced
'motherboards' as they are known in microcomputers: boards of a special
size and shape which hold the microprocessor, support circuitry, and the
bus connectors.

   Then things got complicated with the introduction of the 4/6xx series
and the MBus, yielding boards which have characteristics of both CPU and
motherboard. Individual MBus modules, which hold the actual
microprocessors, plug into a VME board which also has SBus slots on it!
For the purposes of this reference, the VME board in question is termed
a 'motherboard'. The SPARCcenter 2000 and SPARCserver 1000 are similar,
but the bus is XDbus instead of VME. Models such as the SPARCserver 10
are simpler, since there the MBus modules plug into a 'motherboard'
which provides SBus slots and support circuitry, but it doesn't also
interface to yet another bus.

   This section covers only CPUs and motherboards. For information on
MBus modules, see "HARDWARE/Boards/SPARC (MBus) Modules".

         Overview by Model
         -----------------

   This list shows what official models shared CPUs/motherboards. Any
model not listed had a CPU/motherboard unique to itself.

                2/100U,2/120,2/150U,2/170
                  The "Sun-2 Multibus" CPU was used in all these models.
                  The "Sun-2 Multibus Prime" CPU was used only in the
                  2/120 and 2/170.

                2/50,2/130,2/160
                   Although the 2/50 and 2/1{30,60} CPUs had different
                   part numbers, they seem to be otherwise identical,
                   variations of the "2050" CPU. Varieties had 1M, 2M,
                   3M, or 4M of RAM onboard.

                3/75,3/140,3/150,3/160,3/180
                   The "3004" or "Carrera" CPU. Varieties had 2M or 4M
                   of RAM onboard.

                3/260,3/280

                3/460,3/470,3/480

                4/110,4/150

                4/260,4/280

                4/310,4/330,4/350,4/360,4/370,4/380,4/390

                4/470,4/490

                4/630,4/670,4/690


         Kernel Architectures
         --------------------

   Within some model lines, there are sufficient differences at a low
level that some machines will not run the same kernel as other machines.
Fortunately, these differences are masked by the kernel and normal
application programs (which include all or virtually all of the
utilities shipped with SunOS) will run across model families. Since
kernel architecture is determined by the design of the CPU or
motherboard, the overview list is here, and each entry in the listing by
part number includes the kernel architecture for that particular board.

   Known kernel architectures are:

            sun2    All Sun-2's.
            sun3    68020-based Sun-3's.
            sun3x   68030-based Sun-3's.
            sun3e?? Single-board embedded Sun-3-based controllers.
            sun386i All Sun386i's, except possibly the fabled 486i.
            sun4    Old VME-based Sun-4's (4/1xx, 4/2xx, 4/3xx, 4/4xx).
            sun4c   Older desktop SPARCstations (1, 1+, 2, SLC, IPC, etc.).
            sun4m   MBus-based SPARCstations.
            sun4e?? Single-board embedded SPARC-based controllers.
            sun4d   XDbus-based servers.
            sun4u   UltraSPARCs (too recent to be listed in this Reference).


         Listing by Part Number
         ----------------------

            Legend
            ------

   Each board has a title, which gives the part number, type (CPU or
motherboard), and model of machine in which it was used. Some boards
have additional information between the type and model, which may
include the amount of memory, presence or absence of certain features,
FCC certification, etc. When an amount of memory is given, the meaning
depends on the type of memory: For boards with built-in, nonremovable
memory, it indicates how much memory that board has, period. For boards
whose memory is on SIMMs, it indicates how much memory the given part
number was preconfigured with at the factory.

   The listing for each board is broken down into the following
categories:

    PROCESSOR:    the actual microprocessor, if known, or "MBus modules"
                   for MBus-based units
    ARCHITECTURE: kernel architecture
    FPU:          the onboard floating-point coprocessor, if any
    MMU:          the type of memory manager, if known
    MEMORY:       details of onboard memory or SIMM slots, if any
    CACHE:        details of off-microprocessor cache, if any
    EXTERNAL BUS: for CPUs, or motherboards which plug into a backplane,
                   the type of bus on the backplane (Multibus, VME, or XDbus)
    BUS:          any bus whose connectors appear on the CPU or
                   motherboard itself (P4, ISA, SBus, MBus)
    POWER:        power requirements, in amps @ volts DC

    LAYOUT:     description of locations of connectors, ports, LEDs,
                 jumpers, switches, and anything else of interest
    MEM LAYOUT: description of locations of memory or SIMM sockets and
                 related jumpers, and instructions for adding memory if
                 possible
    CONNECTORS: any connectors which are not visible on the outside of
                 the machine, with pinouts
    PORTS:      connectors which appear on the outside of the machine
    LEDS:       description of diagnostic LEDs or other indicators

    JUMPERS:  settings of jumpers. Single jumpers and independent pairs
               within blocks are labeled JUMPED (connected) or UNJUMPED
               (disconnected) to indicate the default (i.e. the factory
               setting). When one of a block of jumpers is labeled
               DEFAULT, that means that the settings are mutually
               exclusive and the labeled pair is jumped by default.
    SWITCHES: settings of DIP switches. Independent switches in blocks
               are labeled ON or OFF to indicate the default (i.e. the
               factory setting). When one of a block of switches is
               labeled DEFAULT, that means that the switches are
               mutually exclusive and the labeled switch is on by
               default.

    OTHER FEATURES:         anything which doesn't fall under another category
    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): compatibility notes about other boards
    COMPATIBILITY (ROM):    compatibility notes about versions of boot ROMs
    COMPATIBILITY (SUNOS):  compatibility notes about version of SunOS

   Boards are listed in order of part number.

   Many models had several different part numbers, with slight
   variations between them. In these cases, when the differences are
   small, only the lowest-part-number board has a complete entry, and
   entries for boards with higher part numbers only have the categories
   which differ. In general, if a category is so listed, that entry
   *completely* replaces the one for the lower-numbered board, and if it
   is not listed, then the information is *completely* identical between
   the two boards. The exceptions are categories LAYOUT, CONNECTORS,
   PORTS, JUMPERS, and SWITCHES, where the new information replaces only
   the corresponding information in the lower-numbered board (for
   example, if two pins of one jumper have a different function, only
   those pins are listed for the higher-numbered board).


            Parts
            -----

501-1007        "Sun-2 Multibus" CPU (2/100U,2/120,2/150U,2/170)

    LAYOUT:     The board is entirely concealed within the chassis. On
                one long edge, it has Multibus card-edge connectors (P1
                is the large one and at the top, P2 the small one). On
                the other long edge, from top to bottom, it has:
                    + header connector (J2) for the Sun-1 parallel
                      keyboard and mouse
                    + diagnostic LEDs (8)
                    + 50-pin header connector (J1) for two serial ports

                The boot EPROMs are in the upper near corner at U406
                (grid B10) and U407 (grid B11). The clock battery is in
                the upper far corner. The IDPROM is in the center by the
                68010 at U411 (grid D8).

                Jumper J200 is a single jumper toward the lower edge, by
                the crystal at grid D1.

                Jumper J400 is a block in the upper near, by the EPROMs
                at B10-11, with pin 1 the nearest of the uppermost pair.

                Jumpers J700, J701, J702, and J703 (from bottom to top)
                are single jumpers in a group in the lower far corner,
                by the P2 Multibus connector.

                Jumper J801 is a single jumper along the near edge
                between connector J2 and the LEDs.

    MEM LAYOUT: none

    CONNECTORS: The two serial ports on J1 appear as /dev/ttya and
                /dev/ttyb under SunOS. The documented maximum output
                speed is 19200 bps. Both ports are compatible with both
                RS232C and RS423, using Zilog Z8530A dual UART chips.
                The pinout of J1 is:

                    13   GND-A       32  RTS-B       49  BSY-B

                J2 is for a type-1 (parallel) keyboard and mouse. Jumper
                J801 controls power to the mouse.

    PORTS:      The two serial ports on J1 are usually cabled to the
                rear panel of the machine and labelled as SIO-A and
                SIO-B. The stock cabling is wired DTE.

    LEDS:       There are eight diagnostic LEDs.

    JUMPERS:  J200      Crystal shunt                           JUMPED

                    Boot ROM version 1.1.2 comes in 256K EPROMs.

              J700      Bus priority on serial arbitration      UNJUMPED
                Should be jumped for 2/100U configuration. May need to
                be jumped if the Ciprico Tapemaster tape controller is
                used.

              J701      Common Bus Request arbiter              UNJUMPED
                If the CPU board is used in conjunction with a Multibus
                DMA board (such as a disk or tape controller) that does
                NOT support the Common Bus Request (CBRQ), the CPU board
                must be configured such that it gives up the Multibus
                after every Multibus cycle (by jumping J701). This also
                causes three additional wait states for each Multibus
                access. When this jumper is unjumped, the CPU board
                retains bus mastership until a lower priority master
                requests it by asserting CBRQ. Following a CBRQ, the CPU
                board yields mastership for at least one cycle. Certain
                machine configurations (especially those with color)
                will be much slower if this jumper is jumped.

                Should be jumped for 2/100U configuration. May need to
                be jumped if the Ciprico Tapemaster tape controller is
                used.

                which needs the power.

    SWITCHES: none

    OTHER FEATURES:         This board has a "RasterOp" function, which
                            the comparable 501-1051 does not.

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): May have to jump J1600 on monochrome
                            framebuffer 501-1052-01/02 when used with
                            boot ROM N or below and SunOS 3.0 or later.

    COMPATIBILITY (ROM):    Boot ROM version N or later is required to
                            run SunOS 2.0 or later.

                            Boot ROM version N or earlier may require
                            jumping J1600 on monochrome framebuffer
                            501-1052-01/02 when used with SunOS 3.0 or
                            later.

                            The 2/100U and 2/150U require boot ROM
                            version Q (P/N 501-1103/1104-02) for the Sun
                            VT100-style keyboard.

    COMPATIBILITY (SUNOS):  SunOS 2.0 or later requires boot ROM
                            version N or later.

                            SunOS 3.0 or later may require jumping J1600
                            on monochrome framebuffer 501-1052-01/02 if
                            the boot ROM version is N or earlier.

                            SunOS 4.0 or later requires jumping J701
                            unless the kernel has been patched.


501-1051        "Sun-2 Multibus Prime" CPU (2/120,2/170)
    PROCESSOR:    68010 @ 10MHz
    ARCHITECTURE: sun2
    FPU:          none
    MMU:          ?
    MEMORY:       none
    CACHE:        none
    EXTERNAL BUS: Multibus
    BUS:          none
    POWER:        6A @ +5V, 0.1A at either -5V or -12V

    LAYOUT:     The board is entirely concealed within the chassis. On
                one long edge, it has Multibus card-edge connectors (P1
                is the large one and at the top, P2 the small one). On
                the other long edge, from top to bottom, it has:
                    + header connector (J2) for the Sun-1 parallel
                      keyboard and mouse
                    + diagnostic LEDs (8)
                    + 50-pin header connector (J1) for two serial ports

                The boot EPROMs are in the center below the 68010 at
                U406 (grid B6) and U407 (grid C6). The IDPROM is in the
                center above the 68010 at U411 (grid C11).

                Jumper J100 is a block along the far edge, with pin 1
                the lower of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J102 is a block in the near middle, with pin 1
                the nearest of the uppermost pair.

                Jumper J200 is a single jumper in the near lower corner
                by connector J1.

                Jumper J400 is a block in the center, with pin 1 the
                farthest of the lowermost pair.

                Jumper J700 is a block in the lower far corner, with pin
                1 the farthest of the lowermost pair.

                Jumper J701 is a block below J100, with pin 1 the
                farthest of the lowermost pair.

                Jumper J801 is a single jumper along the near edge
                between connector J2 and the LEDs.

    MEM LAYOUT: none

    CONNECTORS: The two serial ports on J1 appear as /dev/ttya and
                /dev/ttyb under SunOS. The documented maximum output
                speed is 19200 bps. Both ports are compatible with both
                RS232C and RS423, using Zilog Z8530A dual UART chips.
                The pinout of J1 is:

                    3    TxD-A       14  DTR-A       33  DD-B
                    4    DB-A        15  DCD-A       34  CTS-B
                    5    RxD-A       22  DA-A        36  DSR-B

                    13   GND-A       32  RTS-B       49  BSY-B

                J2 is for a type-1 (parallel) keyboard/mouse.

    PORTS:      The two serial ports on J1 are usually cabled to the
                rear panel of the machine and labelled as SIO-A and
                SIO-B. The stock cabling is wired DTE.

    LEDS:       There are eight diagnostic LEDs.

                    If the CPU board is used in conjunction with a
                    Multibus DMA board (such as a disk or tape
                    controller) that does NOT support the Common Bus
                    Request (CBRQ), the CPU board must be configured
                    such that it gives up the Multibus after every
                    Multibus cycle (by jumping this pair). This also
                    causes three additional wait states for each
                    Multibus access. When this jumper is unjumped, the
                    CPU board retains bus mastership until a lower
                    priority master requests it by asserting CBRQ.
                    Following a CBRQ, the CPU board yields mastership
                    for at least one cycle. Certain machine
                    configurations (especially those with color) will be
                    much slower if this jumper is jumped.

    OTHER FEATURES:         This board does not have a "RasterOp"
                            function, which the comparable 501-1007
                            does.

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): May have to jump J1600 on monochrome
                            framebuffer 501-1052-01/02 when used with
                            boot ROM N or below and SunOS 3.0 or later.

    COMPATIBILITY (ROM):    Boot ROM version N or earlier may require

    EXTERNAL BUS: VME
    BUS:          none
    POWER:        14A @ +5V, 0.8A @ -5V

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top edge at left), the
                external connectors are: a female DA15 AUI Ethernet
                connector; eight LEDs (bit 0 to the top/left); a switch
                to toggle between Normal and Diagnostics modes; a reset
                switch; a female DE9 monochrome video connector; a
                female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; and two female
                DB25 serial ports (ports A and B from left to right
                (top/bottom)).

                The boot PROM is on the near left side at location U1200
                (grid C5). The EEPROM is next to the boot PROM on the
                near side. The IDPROM is catty-corner from the boot PROM
                and to the right of the EEPROM at location U1409 (grid
                B10). The keyboard fuse is by the reset switch at grid
                A10. The Ethernet fuse is in the middle of the right
                edge, near J1001, at grid E34.

                Some jumper blocks have separate J??? designations for
                each pair.

                Jumper J100 is the far middle pair of a block on the
                left side, beyond the 68881. (Also contains J2505,
                J3101, and J3102.)

                rightmost of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J400 is a block toward the far left corner, pin 1
                the rightmost of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J1001 is a single jumper in the middle right,
                near the Ethernet fuse.

                Jumper J1200 and J1201 are the middle and far pairs of a
                block in the near left corner. (Also contains J2502.)

                Jumper J2301 is a single jumper in the near middle, to
                the right of the divider.

                Jumper J2501 is the near pair of a block in the near
                left. (Also contains J2503.)

                Jumper J2502 is the near pair of a block in the near
                left corner. (Also contains J1200 and J1201.)

                Jumper J2503 is the far pair of a block in the near
                left. (Also contains J2501.)

                Jumper J2505 is the fair pair of a block on the left
                side, beyond the 68881. (Also contains J100, J3101, and
                J3102.)

                Jumpers J2700, J2701, J2702, and J2703 are the pairs,
                far to near, of a block in the far left.

                Jumpers J3101 and J3102 are the near and near middle
                pairs of a block on the left side, beyond the 68881.
                (Also contains J100 and J2505.)

    OTHER FEATURES:         --

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): The minimum board revision required for use
                            with the 501-1125 or 501-1214 IPC is
                            501-1100-06.

    COMPATIBILITY (ROM):    When "CPU EPROM 2.1" (probably boot ROM
                            version 2.1) is installed, two control-G's
                            cause the keyboard bell to remain on until
                            the system is reset.

                            Boot ROM version 2.6 or later is required to
                            boot from an SMD disk connected to a
                            501-1249 Xylogics 7053 SMD controller.

501-1129        CPU OBSOLETE (4/2xx)
    PROCESSOR:    SF9010 @ 16.67MHz
    ARCHITECTURE: sun4
    FPU:          Weitek 1164/1165
    MMU:          Sun-4, 16 hardware contexts
    MEMORY:       none
    CACHE:        on-chip
    EXTERNAL BUS: VME
    BUS:          none
    POWER:        ?

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top edge at left), the
                external connectors are: two serial ports (A and B from
                left to right (top/bottom)); an Ethernet connector; a
                reset switch; eight LEDs (bit 0 to the right/bottom); a
                switch to toggle between Normal and Diagnostic modes; a
                keyboard/mouse connector; and a video connector.

                The four boot PROMs form a line in the middle of the
                left half of the board, 1504-1507, nearest to farthest,
                respectively. The IDPROM is to the left of the nearest
                boot PROM, location U1902 at grid D5. The 3V battery is
                along the middle far edge. The Ethernet fuse is in the
                near right, near the Weitek chips, at grid C29. The
                keyboard fuse is along the right near edge at grid A26.

                Some jumper blocks have separate J??? designations for
                each pair.

                Jumpers J301 through J304 are the pairs, from right to
                left, of a block in the left middle, to the right of the
                nearest boot PROM.

                Jumper J601 is a block in the far left, with pin 1 the
                leftmost of the farthest pair.

                Jumpers J2001 and J2002 are the far and middle pairs of
                a block in the far left, to the left of the farthest
                boot PROM. J2401 is in the same block.

                Jumper J2003 is a single jumper along the near left
                edge.

                Jumper J2201 is a single jumper in the near left corner.

                Jumper J2401 is the near pair of a block in the far
                left, to the left of the farthest boot PROM. J2001 and
                J2002 are in the same block.

                Jumpers J2402 through J2404 are the pairs, from right to
                left, of a block in the far middle, near the 3V battery.

                Jumper J2701 is a single jumper along the middle near
                edge, by the diagnostic LEDs.

                Jumper J2901 is a single jumper in the near left, to the
                right of J2904.

                Jumper J2902 is a single jumper in the near middle.

                Jumper J2904 is a single jumper in the near left, to the
                left of J2901.

    MEM LAYOUT: No main memory.

                Framebuffer memory.

    CONNECTORS: none

    PORTS:      serial ports: Jumper J22-1 controls the serial port
                  clock.

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top at left), the
                external connectors are: a female DA15 AUI Ethernet
                connector; a switch to toggle between Normal and
                Diagnostics modes; eight LEDs (bit 0 to the left/top); a
                female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; two female DB25
                serial ports (ports A and B from left to right
                (top/bottom)); four BNC color video connectors; and a
                reset switch.

                The boot PROM is in the near left, at location U1200.
                The EEPROM is just to the right of the boot PROM. The
                IDPROM is in the near middle at location U1409. The 8530
                UARTs are in the middle, nearer than the 68881. The
                Ethernet fuse is by the diag/norm switch at grid A6 and
                the keyboard fuse is by the keyboard connector at grid
                A12.

                Some jumper blocks have separate J??? designations for
                each pair.

                Jumpers J400, J100, J2703, J2701, J2702, and J2700 are
                the pairs of a block in the far left, apparently in that
                order from nearest to farthest. On the diagram in the FE
                manual, there are eight jumper pairs, and it is not
                clear exactly what is where.

                Jumper J300 is a block in the far left corner, with pin
                1 the rightmost of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J1001 is a single jumper in the middle, to the
                right of the 68881.

                Jumpers J1200 and J1201 are the nearer and farther pairs
                of a block along the left edge.

                Jumper J1700 is a single jumper in the near right
                corner.

                Jumper J2500 is a single jumper along the left edge.

                Jumpers J2501 and J2503 are the farther and nearer pairs
                of a block in the near left corner.

                Jumper J2502 is a single jumper in the far left corner,
                beyond J300.

                Jumper J3101 (J3100?) is a single jumper in the middle
                right.

    MEM LAYOUT: 4M built-in, in the middle right. See jumper J3101
                (J3100?).

                Framebuffer memory.

    CONNECTORS: none

    PORTS:      AUI Ethernet: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Ethernet/FOO-AAA". Jumper J2500 sets the transceiver
                  type. Jumper J2501 controls the Ethernet clock. Jumper
                  J2503 controls +5V on pin 7.

                keyboard/mouse: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Keyboard and Mouse/FOO-AAC".

                serial ports: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Serial/FOO-AAD". The serial ports conform to both
                  RS232C and RS423 and are wired DTE. The documented
                  maximum speeds are 19200 bps for output and 9600 bps
                  for input. Jumper J1001 controls the serial port
                  clock.

                color video: The onboard framebuffer is a cgfour. The
                  four video connectors are Blue, Green, (or possibly
                  Gree, Blue: sources disagree) Red, and Sync from left
                  to right (top/bottom). The resolution is 1152 x 900 at
                  61.8KHz horizontal sync and 66Hz vertical sync. Jumper
                  J1700 controls the video clock.

501-1141        2050 CPU 1M (2/50)
    PROCESSOR:    68010 @ 10MHz
    ARCHITECTURE: sun2
    FPU:          none
    MMU:	  ?
    MEMORY:       1M
    CACHE:        none
    EXTERNAL BUS: VME
    BUS:          none
    POWER:        12A @ +5V, 1A @ +12V, 0.5A @ -12V

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                eight LEDs; a female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; two
                female DB25 serial ports (ports A and B from left to
                right (top/bottom)); a female DA15 AUI Ethernet
                connector; and a female DE9 monochrome video connector.

                The boot PROMs are along the near left edge at grid A12
                and A15. The IDPROM is just beyond the boot PROMs at
                grid A19. The missing (?) chips at grid A/B3-7 (9518)
                and E6 (P16R4) were for hardware-assisted DES
                encryption.

                Jumper J200 is a block in the near middle at grid F9,
                with pin 1 in the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J500 is a block in the middle left edge at grid
                A16-17, with pin1 in the farthest pair.

                Jumper J702 is a single jumper in the near right at grid
                I-J5, closer to I.

                Jumper J704 is a single jumper in the near right at grid
                I-J5, closer to J.

                Jumper J800 is a block in the far left at grid D37, with
                pin1 in the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J900 is a block in the far left at grid C37, with
                pin 1 in the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J1201 is a block in the far left at grid D29,
                with pin 1 in the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J1600 is a block in the leftish middle at grid
                E17, with pin 1 in the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J1801 is a single jumper in the near right corner
                at grid L-M6.

    MEM LAYOUT: 1M built-in, consisting of 64Kx1 DIPs occupying
		positions 40-57 of rows N-U (note that the coordinate
		system changes in the memory area, in the far right
		corner of the board). There is one bit of parity per
                byte. See pins 13-14 of jumper J200, and jumper J1201.

                Framebuffer memory.

    CONNECTORS: none

    PORTS:      keyboard/mouse: The pinout of the keyboard/mouse
                  connector is probably the same as for any Sun-3 with a
                  DB15 connector ("SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/Keyboard
                  and Mouse/FOO-AAC").

                serial ports: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Serial/FOO-AAH". The serial ports appear to conform to
                  both RS232 and RS423 and are wired DTE. Pins 1-2 of
                  jumper J200 control the serial port clock.

                AUI Ethernet: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Ethernet/FOO-AAI". Jumper J702 controls +5V on pin 7.
                  Jumper J704 sets the transceiver type.

                monochrome video: the onboard framebuffer is a bwtwo.
                  The video output levels are ECL/TTL. The output may
                  have a variety of resolutions, but is by default 1152
                  x 900 at 61.8KHz horizontal sync and 66Hz vertical
                  sync. See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/Video/FOO-AAJ."
                  Jumper J1801 controls the video clock.

    LEDS:       There are eight diagnostic LEDs. See "SPECIAL TOPICS/
                Diagnostic LED Summary/'2/50,2/130,2/160'".

                The backplate is (probably) two VME slots high.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top at left), the
                external connectors are: a keyboard connector; eight
                LEDs (bit 0 to the right/bottom); a switch to toggle
                between Normal and Diagnostic modes; an Ethernet
                connector; two serial ports (B and A from left to right
                (top/bottom)); a SCSI connector; and a reset button (?).

                The boot PROMs are in the far right corner at locations
                U601-U604 (right to left, grid K-M29). Nearby, along the
                right edge, is a 3V battery. The P4 connector is in the
                middle right, by the divider. The IDPROM is nearer on
                the right, at location U805 (grid M9). The keyboard fuse
                F1000 is at grid C2 near the keyboard connector and the
                Ethernet fuse F1800 is at grid F2 near the Ethernet
                connector. The sockets for the Weitek 1164/1165 are in
                the near left corner at locations U201 (1164) and U202
                (1165).

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of four banks of eight 120ns SIMMs,
                either 256K (501-1314) or 1M (501-1466). The SIMM
                sockets occupy the middle and left sections of the far
                half of the board.

                Valid memory combinations are 8M (all banks 256K), 16M
                (two banks (2,4) of 1M), 20M (two banks (2,4) of 1M and
                two banks (1,3) of 1M), or 32M (all banks 1M).

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the VME power connector.

                The backplate is two VME slots high.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                a female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; eight LEDs (bit
                0 to the right); a switch to toggle between Normal and
                Diagnostics modes; a BNC thin Ethernet connector; a
                female DA15 AUI Ethernet connector; two female DB25
                serial port connectors (ports B and A from left to
                right); a female DD50 SCSI connector; and a female DE9
                monochrome video connector. Above these are an upper row
                of cutouts or connectors for color video and other
                options.

                The Ethernet fuse is in the far left corner by the 3V
                battery, at grid J39. The IDPROM is at location U224
                (grid I20) in the leftish middle. The boot PROM is at
                location U300 (grid K8) in the middle left. The 8530
                UARTs are in the middle to near left side, closer than
                the boot PROM. The keyboard fuse is in the near left
                corner by the keyboard connector at grid K1. The P4A and
                P4B connectors are on the right side on either side of
                the middle bar; the P4B "connector" is normally just a
                bunch of solder pads.

                Jumper J800 is a block in the far left, with pin 1 the
                nearest of the leftmost pair.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to 24 1M (501-1239) x 9 30-pin
                SIMMs, rated 100ns or faster, installed in groups of
                four. The SIMM slots form a row in the far middle of the
                board.

                SIMMs are installed starting nearest the middle of the
                board and moving forward toward the edge with the power
                connector. The amount of memory seen is controlled by
                pins 1-12 of J800.

                Framebuffer memory.

                AUI Ethernet: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Ethernet/FOO-AAK". Pins 13-14 of jumper J800 control
                  whether the thin or AUI Ethernet connector is active.

                serial ports: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/
                  Serial/FOO-AAD". The serial ports conform to both
                  RS232C and RS423 and are wired DTE.

                SCSI: See "SPECIAL TOPICS/Pinout Summary/SCSI/FOO-AAL".
                  Note that pin 26 (TERMPWR) is connected to ground on
                  board revisions 501-1205-09 or lower. This can cause a

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top edge at left), the
                external connectors are: a female DA15 AUI Ethernet
                connector; eight LEDs (bit 0 to the top/left); a switch
                to toggle between Normal and Diagnostics modes; a reset
                switch; a female DE9 monochrome video connector; a
                female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; and two female
                DB25 serial ports (A and B from left to right
                (top/bottom)).

                The boot PROM is in the near left at location U1200
                (grid C5). The IDPROM is catty-corner from the boot PROM
                at location U1409 (grid B10). The EEPROM is nearer than
                the boot PROM and to the left of the IDPROM. The
                keyboard fuse is by the reset switch at grid A16. The
                Ethernet fuse is by the boot PROM at grid C8.

                Some jumper blocks have separate J??? designations for
                each pair.

                Jumper J100 is the far middle pair of a block in the
                middle left. J2505, J3101, and J3102 are in the same
                block.

                Jumper 300 is a block in the far left corner, with pin 1
                the rightmost of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J400 is a block in the far left, with pin 1 the
                rightmost of the nearest pair.

                Jumper J1001 is a single jumper in the middle right.

                Jumpers J1200 and J1201 are the middle and far pairs of a
                block in the near left corner. J2502 is in the same
                block.

                Jumper J2301 is a single jumper in the near middle.

                Jumper J2501 is the near pair of a block in the near
                left. J2503 is in the same block.

                Jumper J2502 is the near pair of a block in the near
                left corner. J1200 and J1201 are in the same block.

                Jumper J2503 is the far pair of a block in the near
                middle. J2501 is in the same block.

                Jumper J2505 is the far pair of a block in the middle
                left. J100, J3101, and J3102 are in the same block.

                Jumpers J2700, J2701, J2702, and J2703 are the pairs,
                from farthest to nearest, of a block in the far left.

                Jumpers J3101 and J3102 are the near and near middle
                pairs of a block in the middle left. J100 and J2505 are
                in the same block.

    LAYOUT:     From left to right, with component side up and external
                connectors AWAY from you, the external connectors are: a
                male DB25 serial connector; a parallel port connector;
                eight LEDs (bit 0 to the left); and a female DA15 AUI
                Ethernet connector.

                The boot PROM is in the far middle at location U602
                (grid B8). To the right of it is the NVRAM at location
                U603 (grid B9), and to the right of that is the IDPROM
                at location U601 (grid B10). The ISA slots are in the
                far left; the 32-bit slots are in the middle. Beyond the
                ISA slots are five voltage test points (+5, GND, +12,
                -12, and -5 from left to right). Next to the IDPROM is
                the SCSI connector, with pin 1 in the far left. In line
                but nearer is the floppy data/control connector, with
                pin 1 in the near right. The power supply connector is
                along the right edge just beyond the jag in the edge.
                Along the jag is the floppy/disk power connector (four
                pins, pin 1 at right), and somewhat nearer are the fan
                power connector (two pins, pin 1 at left) and the front
                panel LED power connector (three pins, pin 1 farthest).
                In the near left corner is the speaker connector (three
                pins, pin 1 farthest). The Ethernet fuse is near the
                serial and parallel connectors, and the SCSI fuse is
                near the SCSI connector. Both fuses are 1A subminiature
                fuses, P/N 140-1027.

                There are three single jumpers, in a loose line in the
                near right, with jumper 0 farthest.

    BUS:          none
    POWER:        17.2A @ +5V, 1.3A @ -5V, 0.4A @ +12V

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top edge at left), the
                external connectors are: two serial ports (A and B from
                left to right (top/bottom)); an Ethernet connector; a
                switch to toggle between Normal and Diagnostic modes;
                eight LEDs (bit 0 to the right/bottom); a reset switch;
                a keyboard/mouse connector; and a video connector.

                The four boot PROMs form a line in the middle of the
                left half of the board, U2001-U2004 (1507-1504, grid J10
                through E10, farthest to nearest, respectively). The
                IDPROM is near the U2004 PROM, at location U1901, grid
                D5. The 3V battery is along the near edge near serial
                port B. The Ethernet fuse is in the near right, near the
                Weitek chips, at grid C29. The keyboard fuse is near the
                keyboard connector at grid A26.

                Some jumper blocks have separate J??? designations for
                each pair.

                Jumpers J0301 through J0303 are the pairs, from right to
                left, of a block in the left middle to the right of the
                U2004 boot PROM.

                Jumper J0304 is a single jumper in the left middle, to
                the right of the U2003 PROM.

                Jumper J0401 is a block in the far left.

                Jumpers J2001 and J2002 are the far and middle pairs of
                a block in the far left, to the left of the U2001 boot
                PROM. J2401 is in the same block.

                Jumper J2003 is a single jumper in the near left.

                Jumper J2201 is a single jumper in the near left, by the
                battery.

                Jumper J2401 is the near pair of a block in the far
                left, to the left of the U2001 boot PROM. J2001 and
                J2002 are in the same block.

                Jumpers J2402 through J2404 are the pairs, from right to
                left, of a block in the far middle.

                Jumper J2701 is a single jumper in the near middle, by
                the LEDs.

                Jumper J2801 is a single jumper in the far left, near
                J0401.

                Jumper J2902 is a single jumper in the near left.

                Jumper J2904 does not appear on any diagrams and hence
                its location is unknown.

    MEM LAYOUT: No main memory.

                           Diagnostic messages are sent to serial port A
                           at 9600 bps (or serial port B at 1200 bps?).

              RESET
                Invokes a watchdog reset. The result depends on the
                value at address 0x17 of the EEPROM. (?) (See
                "SOFTWARE/EEPROM Settings".)

    OTHER FEATURES:         If memory boards are installed on both
                            sides of this board, the terminator pack at
                            U1411 should be removed.

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): If the 501-1105 FPA or 501-1446 FPA+ is
                            being used with this board, any 8M memory
                            cards must be 501-1102-11 or later.

                            This board is not compatible with 501-1254
                            32M memory boards. However, it is
                            compatible with the similar 501-1451 32M
                            memory boards.

                            P4-based cgeight framebuffers must be
                            501-1371-04 or later for use with this
                            board.

                            Jumpers P10, P11, P12, and P13 should be
                            removed from the 501-1598 and 501-1832
                            backplanes when this board is installed.

                            This board may not be compatible with the
                            SunLink Channel Adapter -- the 501-1550
                            board may be required instead.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to eight 1M (501-1408, 501-1466,
                501-1544, 501-1565, or 501-1697) or 4M (501-1682 or
                501-1739) x 9 30-pin SIMMs in two banks in the middle to
                far right, U1300-U1307 from nearest to farthest. The
                nearer four are bank 0, bytes 0-3, and the farther four
                are bank 1, bytes 0-3.

                4M SIMMs are "not supported on the Sun-4/330 CPU" and
                require boot PROM version 3.0.3 or later.

    POWER:        5.8A @ +5V

    LAYOUT:     From left to right, with component side up and external
                connectors AWAY from you, the external connectors are: a
                male DB25 serial connector; a parallel port connector;
                eight LEDs (bit 0 to the left); and a female DA15 AUI
                Ethernet connector.

                The boot PROM is in the far middle at location U602
                (grid B8). To the right of it is the NVRAM at location
                U603 (grid B9), and to the right of that is the IDPROM
                at location U601 (grid B10). The ISA slots are in the
                far left; the 32-bit slots are in the middle. Beyond the
                ISA slots are five voltage test points (+5, GND, +12,
                -12, and -5 from left to right). Next to the IDPROM is
                the SCSI connector, with pin 1 in the far left. In line
                but nearer is the floppy data/control connector, with
                pin 1 in the near right. The power supply connector is
                along the right edge just beyond the jag in the edge.
                Along the jag is the floppy/disk power connector (four
                pins, pin 1 at right), and somewhat nearer are the fan
                power connector (two pins, pin 1 at left) and the front
                panel LED power connector (three pins, pin 1 farthest).
                In the near left corner is the speaker connector (three
                pins, pin 1 farthest). The Ethernet fuse is near the
                serial and parallel connectors, and the SCSI fuse is
                near the SCSI connector. Both fuses are 1A subminiature
                fuses, P/N 140-1027.

                There are three single jumpers, in a loose line in the
                near right, with jumper 0 farthest.

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the VME power connector.

                The backplate is two VME slots high.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                a female DA15 keyboard/mouse connector; eight LEDs (bit
                0 to the right); a switch to toggle between Normal and
                Diagnostics modes; a BNC thin Ethernet connector; a
                female DA15 AUI Ethernet connector; two female DB25
                serial ports (ports B and A from left to right); and a

                row of cutouts or connectors for color video and other
                options.

                The Ethernet fuse is in the far left corner by the 3V
                battery, at grid J39. The IDPROM is at location U224
                (grid I20) in the leftish middle. The boot PROM is at
                location U300 (grid K8) on the left side in the middle.
                The 8530 UARTs are also on the left side, toward the
                near end from the boot PROM. The keyboard fuse is in the
                near left corner by the keyboard connector at grid K1.
                The P4A connector is on the right side near the middle
                bar.

                nearest of the leftmost pair.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to 24 30-pin SIMMs, rated 100ns or
                faster, installed in groups of four. The first sixteen
                are 256K (501-1349) x 9, and the last eight are 1M
                (501-1346) x 9. The SIMM slots form a row in the far
                middle of the board.

                SIMMs are installed starting nearest the middle of the
                board and moving forward toward the edge with the power
                connector. The amount of memory seen is controlled by
                pins 1-4 of J800.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to sixteen 1M (501-1408) or 4M
                (501-1625 or 501-1739) x 9 30-pin 80 or 100ns SIMMs, in
                four banks. The SIMM slots span the middle of the board,
                in two columns.

                Banks must be filled in the order 0, 2, 1, 3, and SIMM
                types may not be mixed within banks.

    LAYOUT:     The 4/20 chassis is combined with its monitor. The
                motherboard is an unusual shape because it resides in a
                vertical slot in the case behind the monitor tube. It
                slides in from the top with the component side facing
                toward the front of the machine.

                With component side up and the SIMM slots on the right
                (normal top edge at the top), there are six diagnostic
                LEDs on the top edge (bit 0 leftmost). On the bottom
                edge is an edge connector which supplies power and
                connects the CPU to the signal connectors mounted on a
                separate board on the rear of the monitor chassis. The
                boot PROM is along the upper edge toward the left, at
                location U1001. The NVRAM is to the right of the boot
                PROM at location U1011. SCSI fuse F0901 and Ethernet
                fuse F1101 are toward the left bottom, near the edge
                connector, and are both non-replaceable PTC devices.

                There are no jumpers.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to four 4M x 33 72-pin SIMMs

                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                a female HD50 SCSI connector; an Ethernet connector; two

                8-pin-DIN keyboard/mouse connector; and an audio
                connector.

                The boot PROM is in the near middle at location U0501.
                The NVRAM/TOD/ID chip is to the left of the boot PROM at
                location U0512. Along the far edge, more or less from
                left to right, are the floppy power, power, floppy,
                LED/speaker, and two pairs of internal SCSI and disk
                power connectors. The SBus connectors are in a row from
                left (slot 1) to right (slot 3) across the middle. The
                J0705/SAX connector is in the middle left by the slot 1
                SBus connector.

                Jumper GND1 is a single jumper in the middle right edge.

                Jumper GND2 is a single jumper in the near left.

                Jumper GND3 is a single jumper in the near right.

                Jumper ??? is a block in the near right.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to sixteen 4M (501-1739) x 9 80ns
                30-pin SIMMs, in four banks. Each bank consists of one
                slot in each group of four. The SIMM slots form two
                columns in the far half of the board.

                THERE IS SOME DISPUTE OVER WHICH SLOTS BELONG TO WHICH
                BANKS, or alternatively what order to fill them. The Sun
                Field Engineer Handbook for 12/15/93 says that the banks
                are in order as shown above but doesn't give a fill
                order. Other sources agree that banks are in order 0, 2,
                1, 3, and should be filled in numerical order, which is
                interestingly equivalent to a *fill* order of 0, 2, 1, 3
                with the banks in numerical order as shown -- and that
                was the fill order of near relatives (the SPARCstation 1
                and 1+).

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the three VME connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you (normal top edge at left), the
                external connectors are: eleven LEDs (bit 0 to the
                right/bottom); a switch to toggle between Normal and
                Diagnostic modes; a "scan" button; two serial ports (A
                and B from left to right (top/bottom)); a keyboard/mouse
                connector; an audio connector; an Ethernet connector;
                and a HD50 SCSI connector.

                The boot PROMs are in the near left corner at locations
                U3001, U3002, U3004, and U3003 (clockwise from far
                right). The NVRAM chip is in the middle, at location
                U2701. The serial ports A and B fuses (F2801/F2802) are
                along the middle of the near edge. The keyboard fuse
                F2601 is by the keyboard connector, the Ethernet fuse
                F2301 is by the Ethernet connector, and the SCSI fuse
                F2201 is by the SCSI connector. The SBus connectors are
                in a row across the middle of the board, with slot 0 on
                the left. The MBus connectors are in the far right, with
                slot 1 farther away and slot 2 closer.

                Jumper J1701 is a single jumper in the far left, nearer
                than J1803 and to the left of J1702.

                Jumper J1702 is a single jumper in the far middle,
                nearer than J1706 and to the right of J1701.

                Jumper J1703 is a single jumper in the far middle,
                between J1702 on the left and J1704 on the right.

                Jumper J1704 is a single jumper in the far middle,
                nearer than J1802 and to the right of J1703.

                Jumper J1705 is a single jumper in the middle, to the
                left of J3201, nearer than SBus slot 1.

                Jumper J1706 is a three-pin jumper in the far middle,
                farther than J1702 and to the right of J1803, near the
                P2 VME connector, with pin 1 nearest.

                Jumper J1801 is a block in the far right corner, with
                pin 1 the nearest of the leftmost pair.

                Jumper J1802 is a single jumper in the far middle,
                farther than J1704, near the P2 VME connector.

                Jumper J1803 is a single jumper in the far left, farther
                than J1701 and to the left of J1706.

                Jumper J2202 is a single jumper in the near right
                corner.

                Jumper J2602 is a three-pin jumper in the near middle
                edge, near the keyboard/mouse connector, with pin 1
                nearest.

                Jumper J2603 is a single jumper in the near middle.

                Jumper J2803 is a three-pin jumper in the near middle,
                nearer than J2804, with pin 1 nearest.

                Jumper J2804 is a three-pin jumper in the near middle,
                farther than J2803, with pin 1 nearest.

                Jumper J3201 is a single jumper in the near middle, to
                the right of J1705.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to thirty-two 4M (501-1739) or 16M
                (501-2060) x 9 80ns 30-pin SIMMs in two banks of 16
                each. Bank 0 is on the left (starts with U1107 nearest,
                ends with U1401 farthest), bank 1 is on the right
                (starts with U1108 nearest, ends with U1402 farthest).
                The banks form two columns in the left and middle
                sections respectively of the far half of the board.

                Banks cannot be partially filled. The chart in the FE
                manual looks like this, for whatever it's worth:

    LAYOUT:     From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                a HD50 SCSI connector; an Ethernet connector; two serial
                ports (ports B and A from left to right, apparently
                DE9); a 13W3 video connector; an 8-pin-DIN
                keyboard/mouse connector; and an audio connector.

                The boot PROM is in the middle left edge at location
                U0902. The NVRAM/TOD/ID chip is nearer than the boot
                PROM, at location U0901. At the far edge, from left to
                right, are the power, floppy, speaker, and internal SCSI
                connectors. The Ethernet (F0802) and SCSI (F0801) fuses
                are in the near left corner, P/N 150-1174. (150-1974 and
                150-1162 repsectively may also work?) The keyboard fuse
                F0901 is by serial port B, P/N 150-1174 (150-1162?). The
                SBus connectors are in a row across the middle of the
                board, slot 1 at the left. The J1004/SAX connector is
                along the middle right edge.

                Jumper J0710 is a three-pin jumper nearer than SBus slot
                1, with pin 1 to the left.

                Jumper J0960 is a three-pin jumper in the near middle,
                to the right of J0961, with pin 1 farthest.

                Jumper J0961 is a three-pin jumper in the near middle,
                to the left of J0960, with pin 1 farthest.

    OTHER FEATURES:         SPARCstation 10 motherboards come in three
                            fab versions: 270-1733-12, 270-1733-13,
                            and 270-1733-14, which have minor layout
                            differences from each other. The 501-1733
                            part comes in fabs 270-1733-12 and
                            270-1733-13 only.

                            TERMPWR on the internal SCSI bus is not
                            connected to TERMPWR on the external SCSI
                            bus and may in fact be grounded; see below.

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): When two 501-2358 SM40 MBus modules are
                            installed, boot ROM version 2.12 is
                            required.

                            Internal SCSI disk drives should have
                            TERMPWR disabled. If it is not and a second
                            MBus module is added, any internal disk
                            drives with PTC protection may trip the
                            power supply overcurrent protection when
                            powering up. Also, the internal cable
                            530-1874-02 has TERMPWR grounded, which may
                            trip the power supply overcurrent protection
                            with PTC-protected disks and blow fuses on
                            fuse-protected disks.

                            The GT and ZX framebuffer options are not
                            supported on boards with MSI 100-2905-02
                            (labelled "LSI Logic L1A6396"). They are
                            only supported on board with MSI 100-2905-03
                            (labelled "LSI Logic L1B7596").

    COMPATIBILITY (ROM):    Boot ROM version 2.12 is required to install
                            two 501-2358 SM40 MBus modules.

    LAYOUT:     From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                a HD50 SCSI connector; an Ethernet connector; two serial
                ports (ports B and A from left to right, apparently
                DE9); a 13W3 video connector; an 8-pin-DIN
                keyboard/mouse connector; and an audio connector.

                The boot PROM is along the middle left edge at location
                U0501. The NVRAM/TOD/ID chip is beyond the boot PROM at
                location U0512. At the far edge, from left to right, are
                the power, floppy, speaker, and internal SCSI
                connectors. In the far left corner are the keyboard
                (F0602) and Ethernet (F0404) fuses, and the SCSI fuse
                (F0403) is in the middle far edge. The fuses are not
                field-replaceable. The SBus connectors are in a row
                across the middle of the board, slot 1 at the left. The
                J0705/SAX connector is in the middle left.

                Jumper J0502 is a three-pin jumper in the near left, to
                the left of J0503, with pin 1 farthest.

                Jumper J0503 is a three-pin jumper in the near left, to
                the right of J0502, with pin 1 farthest.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to four 4M (501-1812) or 16M
                (501-1822 or 501-1915) x 33 72-pin SIMMs. The SIMM slots
                are in the far right.

                SIMM types may be mixed, and should be installed
                according to the table below. The slots are numbered in
                order from U0307 to U0310 going away from the SBus
                connectors, so the first SIMM installed on an empty
                board should always be as far as possible from the SBus
                connectors.

    LAYOUT:     The 4/25 chassis is combined with its monitor. The
                motherboard is an unusual shape because it resides in a
                vertical slot in the case behind the monitor tube. It
                slides in from the top with the component side facing
                toward the front of the machine.

                With component side up and the SIMM slots on the right
                (normal top edge at the top), on the bottom edge is an
                edge connector which supplies power and connects the CPU
                to the signal connectors mounted on a separate board on
                the rear of the monitor chassis. The boot PROM is in the
                upper left at location U0806. The NVRAM is in the upper
                right corner, to the right of the boot PROM, at location
                U0813. SCSI fuse F0701 and Ethernet fuse F0901 are
                toward the left bottom, near the edge connector, and are
                both non-replaceable PTC devices.

                There are no jumpers.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to four 4M (501-1812 or 501-1698)
                or 16M (501-1822) x 33 72-pin SIMMs.

                SIMM types may be mixed, and should be installed
                according to the table below. The slots are numbered in
                order from U0407 to U0410 going away from the edge of
                the board, so the first SIMM installed on an empty board
                should always be closest to the edge.

    POWER:        ?

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has the two XDBus connectors.

                From left to right with component side up and external
                connector edge toward you, the external connectors are:
                nine LEDs (PA, PB, and bits 7-0 from left to right); a
                serial port (port A); a keyboard/mouse connector; and a
                second serial port (port B).

                The boot PROMs are along the near left edge at locations
                U1206, U1204, U1201, and U1200 (farthest to nearest).
                The NVRAM chip is to the right of boot PROM U1206, at
                location U1205. The keyboard fuse (a PTC device) is by
                the keyboard/mouse connector at F1500. The SBus
                connectors are in a row across the middle of the board,
                with slot 0 on the left. There are two fuses or PTCs at
                locations F0300 and F0200, on the left and right ends of
                the row of SBus connectors respectively; FAB 270-1866-03
                uses fuses and FAB 270-1866-04 uses PTCs. The MBus
                connectors are along the left edge, beyond the SBus
                connectors; slot 1 ("SPARC Module A") is nearer and slot
                2 ("SPARC Module B") is farther.

                Jumper J1400 is a three-pin jumper in the near left,
                to the left of J1401, with pin 1 nearest.

                Jumper J1401 is a three-pin jumper in the near left, to
                the right of J1400, with pin 1 nearest.

                Jumper J1501 is a three-pin jumper in the middle near
                edge, near the keyboard/mouse connector, with pin 1 to
                the right.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory is in the form of up to sixteen 8M (501-1817) or
                32M (501-2196) 70ns SIMMs, in interleaved banks of
                eight, with half of each bank attached to each XDBus.
                The SIMM slots form a column in the middle and far
                right.

                The minimum memory configuration is eight SIMMs in bank
                0, and banks cannot be partially filled.

    LAYOUT:     One edge of the board has edge connectors which connect
                to a separate board which has the actual rear panel
                signal connectors. All directions below are given
                assuming component side up and the edge connectors
                toward you.

                The boot PROM is a PLCC, not field-replaceable, toward
                the middle left edge at location U0701. The NVRAM is to
                the left of the boot PROM at location U0707. Ethernet
                fuse F1703 and keyboard fuse F1701 are in the near left
                corner. The SCSI TERMPWR fuse F0601 is in the near
                right. All fuses are non-replaceable PTC devices. Along
                the far edge, from left to right, are the power,
                speaker/LED, floppy, and internal SCSI connectors. The
                SBus connectors are in a row across the middle of the
                board, slot 1 at the left.

                There are no jumpers.

    MEM LAYOUT: Memory consists of up to six 1M (501-2289), 2M
                (501-2433), 4M (501-1991), or 16M (501-2059) 60ns SIMMs.
                The SIMM slots are in the far right.

                SIMMs must be installed in pairs. SIMM types may be
                mixed, and should be installed according to the table
                below. The slots are shown in order from U0304 nearest
                the SBus slots to U0401 nearest the internal SCSI
                connector.

                            TERMPWR on the internal SCSI bus is not
                            connected to TERMPWR on the external SCSI
                            bus and may in fact be grounded; see below.

    COMPATIBILITY (BOARDS): Internal SCSI disk drives should have
                            TERMPWR disabled. If it is not and a second
                            MBus module is added, any internal disk
                            drives with PTC protection may trip the
                            power supply overcurrent protection when
                            powering up. Also, the internal cable
                            530-1874-02 has TERMPWR grounded, which may
                            trip the power supply overcurrent protection
                            with PTC-protected disks and blow fuses on
                            fuse-protected disks.

      --------------------

         Introduction
         ------------

   With the introduction of the 4/6xx series, Sun introduced the MBus,
which allowed for interchangeable and upgradeable processor modules and
Sun's first multiprocessor machines.

   This section covers the processor modules which plug into MBus slots
on motherboards. Any motherboard listed in the "HARDWARE/Boards/'CPUs/
Motherboards'" section which lists "MBus modules" under its PROCESSOR
entry is a candidate for the boards listed below.

CONNECTOR GLOSSARY
==================

   This Reference attempts to use the correct, or at least consistent,
designations for all connectors. Some of these designations are not in
common use, so this glossary lists and describes all connector names
used.

    BNC         Two-conductor (center and shield) coaxial connector with
                twist lock. Typically used for thin Ethernet.

    CARD-EDGE   Not an official designation. A connector, usually
                without a shell, consisting of an extended piece of
                printed-circuit board with conductors on one or both
                sides, or a matching female connector, with a slot into
                which the circuit board extension is pushed. Common
                examples are the ISA, EISA, MicroChannel, PCI, and
                Multibus buses.

    DE          Small D-subminiature shell, commonly used for nine-pin
                serial ports and video connectors, and fifteen-pin VGA
                video connectors.

    DE9         DE shell with nine pins in two rows, commonly called
                DB9. Typically used for serial ports and monochrome
                video connectors.

    DA          Somewhat wider D-subminiature shell, commonly used for
                AUI Ethernet connectors (sometimes incorrectly called
                "thicknet") and game ports on IBM-type PCs.

    DA15        DA shell with fifteen pins in two rows, commonly called
                DB15. Typically used for AUI Ethernet and type-3
                keyboard/mouse connectors.

    DB          The most common size of D-subminiature shell, commonly
                used for 25-pin serial ports, SCSI ports on Macintoshes,
                and parallel ports on IBM-type PCs.

    DB25        DB shell with 25 pins in two rows. Typically used for
                serial ports.

    DD          Large D-subminiature shell, not in common use outside of
                older Sun equipment.

    DD50        DD shell with 50 pins in three rows, commonly called
                DB50 or D50. Typically used for SCSI ports on older
                equipment.

    DIN-8       Not an official designation. Round DIN shell with eight
                pins.

    HD50        Not an official designation. D-subminiature-like shell
                with fifty closely-spaced pins in two rows, typically
                used for SCSI ports on newer equipment.

    HEADER      Not an official designation. A connector, possibly
                without a shell, consisting of pins on 1/8" (???)
                centers, reminiscent of a jumper block, or a matching
                female connector. May have any number of pins or rows.
                Typically used only internally. Common examples are VME
                and the connectors on raw SCSI and IDE disk drives.

        through the tests in the chart above, then boots Unix. Pattern
        11111111 may also mean that a SCSI device was powered up prior
        to the CPU being powered up. If LED 7 (00000001) lights up while
        the tests are being performed, it indicates that the test
        failed. If LED 6 (00000010) lights up while the tests are being
        performed, it indicates that an unexpected error (bus error,
        address error, unexpected interrupt, etc.) occurred during the
        test. When all tests are finished, LED 5 (00000100) starts
        blinking to indicate that the ROM monitor is running and/or Unix
        is booting.
