This patch provides reliable hardware handshake (RTS/CTS) for
the builtin serial lines of all Sun3's under SunOS 4.1.1.

Important change: RTS/CTS for all Sun3's under SunOS 4.1.1.

The problem is mentioned in every jumbo tty patch, but despite
they promised it, Sun aparently never fixed this bug.

This is only a software problem, because Sparcs (which use the same
ol' Zilog 8350 chips than the Sun3's) under Solaris CAN do hardware
handshake (and of course NOT under SunOS 4.1.X).

Hint: You should install the latest jumbo tty patch (100513-04) before.

Many thanks to Brian Katzung (katzung@katsun.chi.il.us) for fixing
this annoying problem.
