  * Connection to Demon Internet - There's plenty of information
    for PC, Linux, etc. Not so much on Sun.

  * I have done this twice - home Sun plus at work. NOT just a
    question of talking, but also of getting service running ...

0.1 The Sun Workstation

The setup I used was:

SunOS wellho 5.5 Generic sun4c sparc SUNW,Sun_4_25
mem = 16384K
Ethernet address = 8:0:20:3:51:da

In other words - a Sun ELC workstation with 16Mbytes of memory
running Solaris 2.5, with nothing special about it.

Oh - the system has a 2Gb disc pack on which there is a full build
of Solaris and a lot of other software as well. If you are using
an existing workstation / setup, 100Mbytes should be ample for all
the extras you might add here put together; you may find that
while you are working, sure, 250Mbytes would be welcome.

0.2 Pre-required in addition to Solaris:

  * External Modem.

  * RS232 Cable.
    Straight (not crossed) cable, pins 2-8 and 20 connected at
    least.
    Connector Types and genders to allow connection from your Sun
    workstation to the modem

  * Phone line.

  * PPP (Merit)
    ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/computing/comms/ip/ppp/merit/unix/ppp-2.2.tar.gz

    Loading instructions ARE included in these notes.

    Ideas for obtaining the file:
       + Is it on your local network? - Copy it - it's not
         licensed software
       + Got a PC with net access or a friend with net access? -
         Load it to there and transfer via floppy.

  * C Compiler
    gcc version 2.6.3
    (Commonly available software)
    (loading instructions NOT included in these notes)

  * Gzip
    gzip 1.2.4 (18 Aug 93)
    (Commonly available software)
    (loading instructions NOT included in these notes)

We believe that these procedures will work equally well with other
c compilers, and other versions of gzip.

Further software will be loaded (further down this procedure) via
FTP once you are on line!

1.0 To Demon

Demon Account required:
Standard dialup service to 0845 07986666

In this example, we have used
  + domain wellho.demon.co.uk
  + IP 158.152.118.164

Note - if this is a brand new Demon account , you need to
initially set a password. Demon will advise.

1.1 PPP

PPP (Point to Point Protocol) is a transmission method which
allows you to bring the internet "down your phone line". Ethernet
packets (including IP or Internet Protocol) are wrapped up for
serial line transfer - you really ARE on the net at your desktop
with PPP!

There are various PPP packages available - we have identified one
we have found easy to set up and use; installation and set up as
follows:

  * Obtain and copy PPP onto disc in a "work" area. On my system,
    I use a directory / slice called /packages.

  * extract files from distribution:

    cd /packages
    gzip -d ppp-2.2.tar.gz
    tar xf ppp-2.2.tar

  * Look at what you have

    cd ppp-2,2
    ls
    Examples       README.cbcp    SETUP          freebsd-2.0    pppd
    NeXT           README.linux   TODO           linux          pppstats
    README         README.osf     aix4           modules        scripts
    README.NeXT    README.sun     chat           net            sunos
    README.aix4    README.svr4    configure      netbsd         svr4
    README.bsd     README.ultrix  etc.ppp        osf1           ultrix

  * run

    setenv CC gcc
    ./configure
    make
    make install

You now have this ppp software in /usr/local; executable, manual
pages, etc!

Next stage is to CONFIGURE PPP so that it will talk to Demon.
  * Set up (file does not exist by default) /etc/ppp/chat-script
    with contents such as:

    "" ATZ
    K ATDT08450798666
    ogin: wellho
    assword: j4d8%eEa
    otocol: PPP

    This is the script for the "exchange" that must take place
    for you to contact Demon and log in. In case an answer comes
    back too fast for your Sun (!), leave the first character off
    the remote responses; e.g "K" not "OK".

    Yes - you WILL need to modify the file to include your own
    host name and password. (And - no - that is NOT really my
    password - always be very careful with your real password!)

  * Make cable connection to modem, Ensure modem is connected to
    line.

  * Test connection and link

    wellho# /usr/local/bin/pppd /dev/term/a 19200 158.152.118.164: \
    connect '/usr/local/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/chat-script'

    [await the connection to establish - watch modem lights, or
    time it at 30 seconds or a little more]

    wellho# route add default 158.152.1.222 0
    add net default: gateway 158.152.1.222
    wellho# ping 158.152.1.14
    158.152.1.14 is alive
    wellho# kill `cat /etc/ppp/ppp0.pid`

What have I achieved up to this point?
  * You have sourced and installed the PPP package which allows
    you to connect your Sun Workstation to the internet via a
    serial cable (and use IP addressing once it's on line)
  * You have configured the package so that it will dial Demon
    Internet, log in and connect to their service.
  * You have tested that this works

What remains?

Your connection is a very basic one so far. The next stages are:
 1. To allow you to resolve host computer and mail address names
    via the "Domain Name Service".
 2. To gather the connection commands together into a script file
    so that you haven't got to type huge commands every time you
    wish to dial in.
 3. To set up and test individual net services, such as mail, web
    access, and news.

1.2 DNS

DNS (The Domain Name Service) is the service through which IP
addresses (such as 158.152.118.164) are converted to host names
(such as wellho.demon.co.uk).

For the purposes of this set up, you do not need to know too much
about DNS, but it IS worth knowing that
  + you need to hook it to a name server for your "domain"
  + which in turn knows about name servers for neighbouring
    domains
and so chains of enquiry around the world can be set up.

To set up your link to DNS

  * Edit the file /etc/nsswitch.conf. Add "dns" to hosts line. It
    will now read

            hosts:      files dns

    Solaris 2 services which need to find out about host
    computers all use the "nsswitch.conf" file as a pointer to
    where the data is to be located. You have now instructed your
    services to look at the local file /etc/hosts, and if that
    does not provide an answer to use the DNS service.

    (If your workstation is part of a larger in house network,
    you may find that you have a more complex entry here. Unless
    "dns" is already present, just add it on the end. If it IS
    already present, you require work beyond the scope of these
    notes)

  * Create a file /etc/resolv.conf, contents:

    domain          demon.co.uk
    nameserver      158.152.1.65
    nameserver      158.152.1.193

    For robustness, there are always at least two name servers in
    any domain. If you get no response from 158.152.1.65, your
    system knows to try 158.152.1.193 instead.

  * Test this by logging in / out as before, but this time "ping"
    a system by name.

    wellho# /usr/local/bin/pppd /dev/term/a 19200 158.152.118.164: \
         connect '/usr/local/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/chat-script'
    [Wait for connection to be made]
    wellho# route add default 158.152.1.222 0
    add net default: gateway 158.152.1.222
    wellho# ping gate.demon.co.uk
    gate.demon.co.uk is alive
    wellho# kill `cat /etc/ppp/ppp0.pid`
    wellho#

Now - here is an OPTIONAL extra. While on line, you might like to
try "nslookup" (it's a standard part of Solaris 2) with which you
can directly access name servers. Helps you to understand what is
going on, and helps you later if you have problems with name
resolving.

Sample nslookup session:

wellho# nslookup
Default Server:  gate.demon.co.uk
Address:  158.152.1.65

> post
Server:  gate.demon.co.uk
Address:  158.152.1.65

Name:    post.demon.co.uk
Addresses:  194.217.242.16, 194.217.242.17, 194.217.242.144, 194.217.242.145

>

First Alternative covers DNS, including setting up your own
server, on their Solaris 2 Advanced System Administration course.

What have I achieved to this point?
  * You have installed PPP software, set up, and tested a link to
    Demon Internet.
  * You have connected to Demon's "name Server" so that you can
    resolve the names of computers all around the world on the
    internet!
  * As a bonus, network services which do not need further
    configuartion are alreay running. You have used "ping" and
    you should also be able to use ftp, telnet, talk, and many
    more.

What remains?
  * Setting up and using services which do need to be configured
  * Consideration of security aspects
  * To gather the connection commands together into a script file
    so that you haven't got to type huge commands every time you
    wish to dial in.

1.3 Email

Is email one of the main reasons for your link? This section tells
you how to set up that service. If you do NOT wish to use email
from your Sun workstation (e.g. if you are setting up JUST a web
browser connection) you can skip this section.

Background ... Mail exchange will be done through the "sendmail"
daemon, using "SMTP" - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. which uses a
configuration file called /etc/mail/sendmail.cf

By default, if you connect into Demon as already described mail
will NOT be exchanged. Your local "sendmail" daemon will not
respond when Demon tries to offer it mail, nor will it route
outgoing mail up to Demon and the rest of the internet.

There is a LOT to sendmail - whole books on it; this setup works
for us, but you may wish to update / research further.

Procedure for setting up email:

  * Various SAMPLE configuartion files are provided, and on a
    newly installed system sendmail.cf will be set up for a
    workstation on a local network which uses a main mail server
    - NOT what you want. You need something MUCH closer to a main
    mail system so:

    wellho# cd /etc/mail
    wellho# cp main.cf sendmail.cf
    cp: overwrite sendmail.cf (y/n)? y
    wellho#

  * Now - you need to edit even THAT configuration. Changes to
    make with your "favourite editor"

       + Around line 21 change

         Lmmaildomain

         to

         Dmwellho.demon.co.uk

         Yes - that should be your own domain name!

       + Around line 34 change

         DMsmartuucp

         to

         DMether

         Sets up IP routeing! Without this change, sendmail tries
         to use uucp - "unix to unix copy" - system for mail
         exchange

       + Around line 37 change

         DR ddn-gateway
         CR ddn-gateway

         to

         DR post.demon.co.uk
         CR post.demon.co.uk

       + Around line 101 change

         DlFrom $g  $d

         to

         DlFrom $f@$j  $d

         This change and the last one affect mail headers; you
         may wish to vary these changes later to suite your own
         needs.

       + Around line 105 change

         Dq$g$?x ($x)$.

         to

         Dq$f@$j$?x ($x)$.

  * Having changed the configuration file, you need to find the
    sendmail daemon and restart it ...

    wellho# ps -ef | grep send
        root   186     1  0 06:48:10 ?        0:00 /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q1h
        root   430   300  1 09:56:17 pts/3    0:00 grep send
    wellho# kill -9 186
    wellho# /usr/lib/sendmail -bd -q1h &

    If you wonder, the parameters to sendmail:
         -bd Run as a daemon to accept incoming mail
         -q1h ("q one h") Process outgoing queue every one hour

  * ENSURE that you have a user account for your email name

  * Now connect (as in previous section) and test.

       + INCOMING mails should arrive automatically

       + Send an outgoing mail (using "mailx") WHILE ON LINE

  * Mail which you "send" while not on line will be held in a
    queue locally, and sent only when the queue is kicked.
    Remember the "q1h" parameter on sendmail? Well - that is an
    instruction for the queue to be activated for send every hour
    - pretty UNlikely to happen while you're on line.

    So - if you write emails off line (sensible thing to do, and
    once you automate the scheme you'll not know when you ARE on
    line), you need to run the following during EACH CONNECTION:

            /usr/lib/sendmail -q

    This will reactivate the queue once. You must then remain on
    line long enough for email exchanges to go through.

  * Now - (not covered in detail here) you need to set up your
    mail system - aliases, .forward files, ensure all users have
    accounts set up, etc.; all "standard" Solaris stuff which
    First Alternative can tell you about on our courses.

What have I achieved to this point?

  * Installation of PPP and a link to Demon
  * Resolution of host names
  * Mail sending and receiving

What remains?

  * Setting up and using other services which need to be
    configured
  * Consideration of security aspects
  * To gather the connection commands together into a script file
    so that you haven't got to type huge commands every time you
    wish to dial in.

1.4 Automating the link and mail exchange

We may want to add to these scripts later, but now seems a
sensible time to start the automation!

Here's the script I use; I chose to place it in
/usr/local/bin/demon

#!/bin/csh -f
#
#   Connection script ...
#
# Set up ppp link to Demon
# Author - Graham Ellis - graham@wellho.demon.co.uk
#                         graham@firstalt.co.uk
#                         01380 813520 (phone & fax)
#
/usr/local/bin/pppd /dev/term/a 19200 158.152.118.164: \
  connect '/usr/local/bin/chat -f /etc/ppp/chat-script'
#
# Allow 30 seconds to establish link
#
sleep 30
#
# Set up packet routing and allow time for Mail exchange, etc
# to get well underway.
#
route add default 158.152.1.222 0
sleep 60
#
# Kick any further services
/usr/lib/sendmail -q
#
# Allow those services time to "complete"
#
sleep 240
#
# If someone has "remote logged in" requested link to stay,
# maintain it. (The "ping" keeps some line activity running
# to avoid disconnect until required
#
while (-e /tmp/remain-here)
       sleep 90
       ping gate.demon.co.uk
end
#
# Close link
#
kill `cat /etc/ppp/ppp0.pid`

  * This script above is "good" for a one-off connection, or for
    including in root's "crontab" to run on a regular basis.

    For example, if you use "crontab -e" to add the following
    line to root's crontab:

            15 6,9,12,15,18 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/demon

    The link will be made automatically, and mail exchanged,
    mondays through Fridays every 3 hours from 06:15 to 18:15.

    Note that emails WILL be sent to root each time it runs; to
    supress this, edit the script "demon" so that

            route add default 158.152.1.222 0

    becomes

            route add default 158.152.1.222 0 > /dev/null

    (no output is then generated by the cron job unless there is
    an error)

  * If you wish to connect to demon and stay on line a while (for
    example to browse the web, or run ftp or telnet), then the
    timed connection of around 6 minutes will allow you to get
    nicely started then will dump you.

    In order to allow you to stay on line, once the connection is
    established

            touch /tmp/remain-here

    Demon "drops" connections which are inactive for a few
    minutes, so the sample script ensures there is traffic via a
    "ping" every 90 seconds. It is VITAL to avoid phone charges
    that you

            rm /tmp/remain-here

    once you have completed your session.

What have I achieved to this point?
  * A PPP link to Demon, automatically exchanging email as and
    when you wish, and running other services which do not
    require additional software or configuration

What remains?
  * Setting up and using other services which need to be
    configured
  * Consideration of security aspects

1.5 Web

To get browsing ...
  * get browser via ftp ...

    ftp to sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk; anonymous login
    software is in
    /packages/Netscape/pub/navigator/3.01/unix
    file netscape-v301-export.sparc-sun-solaris2.4.tar.gz

  * In this example, we have placed the file in a staging
    directory and then copied it up to /usr/local/bin

    wellho# mkdir netscape
    wellho# cd !$
    cd netscape
    wellho# tar xvf ../net*v301*
    x README, 9832 bytes, 20 tape blocks
    x LICENSE, 12965 bytes, 26 tape blocks
    ..... etc
    wellho# cp netscape /usr/local/bin
    wellho#

  * And .. err ... it should work!

    (Remember - you may need to rehash the very first time)

    wellho# netscape
    netscape: Command not found
    wellho# rehash
    wellho# netscape

  * The first time you run the software, it will contact
    netscape's home site - so you do need to be on line. We
    suggest you change the home location to a local file so that
    the browser can be started even when you're offline

  * And - now do remember that this is licensed software and you
    will probably need to register.

1.6 News

Right - before you install all the news software for a local site,
remember that it you're an infrequent news reader, you may prefer
to use an on-line news reader. For example, while on line you
could use the netscape software you installed in the previous
section to

  * Point to / read news from news.demon.co.uk or

  * Point your browser at

            http://www.dejanews.com

Great services, BUT you'll spend a fortune on phone calls is you
become an avid news fan!

  * OK - so you want to feed some news groups down to your Sun
    and surf them off line? Get the following software ...

    ftp to sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk; anonymous login
    software is in
    /packages/news/transport/nntp/nntp/server
    file nntp.1.5.12.2.tar.gz

    ftp to ftp.demon.co.uk; anonymous login
    software is in
    /pub/news/slurp
    file slurp-1.10.tar.Z

    If you don't have it, you will also need Perl.
    We used Perl 5.003
    (Commonly available software)
    (loading instructions NOT included in these notes)
    Perl training is available from First Alternative

To keep this document down to a reasonable length, the
installation and configuration of news server software, and
establishing a news flow from Demon, is in a separate deocument -
located at http://www.firstalt.co.uk/drive/localnews.html.

1.7 Routing

I've set up my Sun workstation using a Demon "10 quid a month"
dial up account.

This gives me a SINGLE IP address, so even if I was connecting a
Sun which is networked to other Suns, those other Suns cannot be
addressed / contacted from Demon.

If I DO need to use my Demon link to connect an entire network to
the internet, I need
  + A more expensive Demon account
  + A registered IP address in my own right
  + And to run routing software
A leased line, or ISDN, might not be a bad idea as well!!

Other notes:
  * Routing software IS standard in Solaris 2.5, and the PPP
    package we used does have some notes about using it to route
    PPP to local ethernet within the documentation.
  * For further information of the Demon accounts, I suggest you
    contact them. I believe they call also register a class "C"
    address for you.
  * Now - you MIGHT find that you can "get around" some of the
    limitations of "no routing" within your local network; yes,
    if I had a network of Suns I could set then up so that I
    could read my mail on any screen, and I could also browse the
    web from any screen. BUT that might contravene Demon's terms
    and conditions of service on the ten-pound-a-month account.

1.8 Other Services (client)

How about ftp, telnet, X Windows, NFS, rlogin rsh rcp, rdate,
finger?

These services are provided as a standard part of Solaris 2.5, and
will work without any internet specific configuration when you are
on line - exactly as they would work between two machines in your
local network.

  * Yes - First Alternative DOES offer training on these!

One service many people are NOT familiar with is "rdate" - the
ability to set your local clock from the network. Demon have a
"time" machine; this example shows how to set your Sun's clock
from it.

Setting your local clock:

wellho# date
Sun Feb  2 17:37:45 GMT 1997
wellho# rdate time.demon.co.uk
Sun Feb  2 17:36:59 1997
wellho# date
Sun Feb  2 17:37:09 GMT 1997
wellho#

    Example shows a local clock that was fast being reset ...

    A useful addition to your log on script?

1.9 Other Services (server)

In general, it's impractical to offer services via your dial up
connection.

  * Solaris 2.5 provides both client and server software for ftp,
    telnet, and many other services.
  * You already have the client ends running, but while you are
    on line people can also access the servers that run on your
    machine.
  * If you log on "casually" from time to time, it's pretty
    impractical for anyone to come in any actually use those
    services, but if you connect regularly and/or for longer
    periods, you may wish to consider offereing a service to
    friends / colleagues. You also need to consider SECURITY.

Providing web pages is slightly different.
  * There is no server provided as standard with Solaris 2.5, but
    many people wish to have their own home page. Using Demon's
    service, you can prepare your web pages locally and load up
    to 5Mbytes up to one of their servers via FTP.
  * If you are seriously into publishing on the web you will
    probably still want Demon to host your pages, but you will
    want to run a local server on your workstation so that you
    can test them. This is a straightforward operation, although
    there are quite a few configuration files and a few tricks.
    If you want to try this out, come on our course!

1.10 Securing yourself against others

OK - so you've decided that it's impractical for your colleagues
to log in / use your system when its on line, even though your
server daemons are running or available. fine.

  * BUT THAT DOES NOT STOP ILLICIT ATTEMPTS AT HACKING into your
    system. While you are on line, what gates are you leaving
    open?

  * To START, you may wish to check the following
       + /etc/hosts.equiv and .rhost settings
       + Do all accounts have good passwords?
       + What services ARE allowed in /etc/inetd.conf
       + What are you sharing to the world via NFS?

  * Further things to think of if you do offer a service include
    xinetd, anonymous ftp, restricted shells ...

1.11 Also via Email / Also via Telnet

  * As you have email and outgoing telnet, the following net
    services will be available ...
       + list servers
       + talkers
       + ftpmail
       + Archie
       + Gopher
         (you may want to run a local Gopher client, however)
       + and others.

  * Yes - you COULD run email based services if you connect in
    with reasonable frequency - list servers and the like.

What have I achieved to this point?
  * you have a dial up connection via Demon internet giving you
    full email and web access, and also news access and other
    services.
  * you have automated the connection to meet your own needs and
    perhaps are offering limited services as well
  * you have considered the security aspects!

What remains?
  * TAKE A BACKUP. A full one. You don't want to have to repeat
    all this work, do you.
  * Enjoy ;-)

2.0 Local Service Provision via RS232

If you wish to connect a local PC into your Sun workstation via IP
protocols / PPP, you CAN do so using the same PPP package that we
used in the earlier example for Demon.

These are brief notes I took when I made such a connection ..
  * Install PPP as above (no need to set up chat-script or
    anything beyond that point

  * Talk on RS232 port via ...

    /usr/local/bin/pppd /dev/term/a 9600 158.152.1.65:

  * Set up *remote* System (we used Trumpet Winsock in a PC) ..

    IP address:  158.152.118.164
    Name Server / Time Server:    158.152.1.65
    Domain Suffix: wellho.demon.co.uk
    MTU 576
    TCP RWIN 2048
    TCP MSS 536
    Demand Load Timeout   5 secs
    TCP RTO MAX   60
    Internal PPP selected
    SLIP Port 2
    Baud Rate 9600
    Hardware handshake OFF
    Van Jacobsen CSLIP compression OFF
    Online Status detection   None

That gets the basics running. I have a web server running on my
Sun workstation, and so my PC can come in via FTP, Telnet, browse
the web, etc ... depending on what windows clients I have

My personal set up does NOT handle mail or news; not much point in
sending mail about 3 feet!!

If you are going to make use of this incoming facility, especially
if you would be doing so via a modem / dial in link, you would
need to consider
  * User Authentication; running a "login" daemon, chat scripts,
    passwords etc
  * Using a different set of IP addresses.
  * How you would handle email.
