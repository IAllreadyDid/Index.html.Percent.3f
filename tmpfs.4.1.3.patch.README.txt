This Patch fixes several problems with tmpfs.

This Patch is for sun3 only (crashes sun3x)!

Important change: The tmpfs jumbo-patch is integrated and the 8lgm-reported
problem from 11/11/94 is fixed. You don't need to make the workaround
mentioned there.

Install as root with the following commands:

foreach i (*.o)
	mv /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ/$i /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ/$i.411
end
cp *.o /sys/`arch -k`/OBJ

Generate a new Kernel:

cd /sys/`arch -k`/conf
setenv KERNELNAME `cat /etc/motd | sed -e "s/.*(//" | sed -e "s/).*//"`
config $KERNELNAME
cd ../$KERNELNAME
make

Install the new Kernel:
mv /vmunix /vmunix.old
mv vmunix /
reboot
