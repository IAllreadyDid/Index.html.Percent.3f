<h1></A>Welcome to the Sun3 Patch Archive</h1>
Now, that Sun has completely dropped the support for the good old
sun3's, i've grabbed all relevant patches, which i could find for
sun3, and put them into this place. I fear, that it won't change
much in the future.
<p>
Click <a href="../PALs/copyright.phtml">here</a> to read Sun's copyright notice.
<p>
This archive contains only patches for SunOS 4.1.1!!!
I've not collected any patches for SunOS 4.0.X or 4.1.
Upgrade your sun3 machines to 4.1.1!
<p>
Unfortunately, this archive is not complete. The reasons are:
<ul>
<li> Some patches continued to evolve, but the sun3 support was
     silently dropped. Fortunately, i was often able to find an
     older version, where a sun3 directory exists.
<li> a couple of patches were only relevant, if some unbundled 
     software was installed. These patches (and the software too)
     are hard to find nowadays.
<li> Archie couldn't locate a copy of the patch anymore.
</ul>
<p>
If you have one of the missing patches or a newer version of an
existing patch, please send it to me. If you find a patch here,
which is NOT relevant (or does have faults!), then give me an
e-mail too.
<p>
You'll notice, that i have a lot more README files than patches
itself. These are README's of older or missing versions. But in
some cases, there exists a newer version of the README than of
the patch. This is generally the case, where the sun3 support
was silently dropped.
