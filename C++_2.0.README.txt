Synopsis: Allows C++ 2.0 to run under SunOS 4.1.1.

This is a README file for a patch that will allow C++ 2.0 to run under
SunOS 4.1.1.  The patch includes newer versions of header files that match
those distributed with SunOS 4.1.1.  Also included is an updated version
of dbx that runs under SunOS 4.1.1.

Included in the patch release:

    README file
    patch installation script
    directory which contains include files for SunOS 4.1.1
    updated version of debugger for sun3 architecture
    updated version of debugger for sun3x architecture
    updated version of debugger for sun4 architecture

Patch installation instructions:

    After you install SunOS 4.1.1 and C++ 2.0, run the extract_patch
    script and enter "yes" when you are prompted if you want to run
    the install_C++_2.0 script.  extract_patch will run the script
    for you.

When the script is complete, you will have a working Sun C++ 2.0
environment on SunOS 4.1.1.
