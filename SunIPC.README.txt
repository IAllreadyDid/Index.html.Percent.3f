Synopsis: Make SunIPC 1.2 work on SunOS 4.1.1
# @(#)README	195.1 - 90/01/11

This is a README file for a set of patches for SunIPC 1.2 and SunOS 4.1.1.
As distributed, SunIPC 1.2 does not work with SunOS 4.1.1; the kernel
interface changed enough to break our distributed files.

Included in this patch release is the following:

    this README file
    new kernel drivers for sun3, sun3x, and sun4 architectures
    a patch installation script ("install_ipc")
    a new SunIPC configuration script ("ipc_configure")
    a new tape extraction script ("1.2_IPC")

Directions for patch installation:

    Install SunOS 4.1.1 (since you're reading this, you've probably
    already done that...)

    Run the install_ipc script (if you are running extract_patch,
    answer "yes" when it asks you if you want to run the install_ipc
    script; extract_patch will run it for you).

    ***IF YOU NEED TO READ IN THE SunIPC 1.2 SOFTWARE FROM TAPE***

	The distributed tape extraction script does not work with SunOS
	4.1.1.  A new extract script is included in this directory
	("1.2_IPC").  Use this script instead of extract_unbundled to
	read the release tape.

	If you are mounting the SunIPC software, this section does not
	effect you.

    ***NOTE FOR SUN3X users***

	The SunIPC 1.2 install script does not know about
	"sub-architectures".  The distributed configuration script
	"files/ipc_configure" will not work in this situation.
	Therefore, you must run the new ipc_configure script instead.
	This script is included in this directory.

	The easiest way to do this is to install the SunIPC 1.2
	software normally, but answer "no" when asked

	    The SunIPC 1.2 software is now installed into your system.
	    Would you like to configure the IPC software?

	(if you are mounting the software instead of reading it from
	tape, then you are already there...)

	Then, instead of running the normal ipc_configure script, run
	the one included in this directory.

	This caveat ONLY applies to the sun3x architecture.


You should now have a working SunIPC 1.2.  Should you have any
problems, contact your local Sun answer center.
